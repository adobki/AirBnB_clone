# AirBnB Clone - Console

Project completed during **ALX Software Engineering** course. It served as an introduction or first steps towards building a full web application. As the title suggests, the endgame of **AirBnB Clone** was to create a website with some of the core functionlities the popular [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/) for property rentals. However, being introductory, this project focused only on the backend, leveraging Python and JSON to build a data storage and retrival system.
Python was used to implement a command interpreter that manages objects _(creates, modifies, deletes, stores, and retrives them)_, while JSON was used for serializing/deserializing created objects for storage/retrival from a basic file storage system that was also implemented in Python.


## Languages and Technologies Used
* Python
* JSON
* Bash

## Project Files
The following were written in python, and tested on Ubuntu and Windows 11:
